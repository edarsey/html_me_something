      I like the sport of Basketball. As a kid, I preferred hockey and I thought that basketball wasn't quite up to the standard of a sport, because scoring a goal was too easy.

    <p>However, when I got to college, it was much easier to find a game of basketball at the gym, than to join a game of hockey, at a rink; I became more interested.</p>
    <p>I grew up in Fort Worth, TX, which is near Dallas, so I naturally became a Dallas Mavericks fan.</p>
    <p>Needless to say, Dirk Nowitzki is awesome</p>
